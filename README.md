# Ultra Low Power LoRa (ULP LoRa) Projects

This repository contains a collection of embedded systems projects developed using a custom **ULP LoRa board**, which is a modified **Arduino Pro Mini** paired with the **RFM95W LoRa module** for ultra-low power, long-range wireless communication.
Link : https://icfoss.in/project-details/52
> Focus: Minimal power usage, real-world sensor interfacing, wireless data transmission, and cloud-based visualization via ChirpStack, InfluxDB, and Grafana.

## Hardware Overview

### ULP LoRa Board

The ULP LoRa board is a minimalistic design built for low-power IoT deployments. It is ideal for remote sensors, data loggers, and anything that benefits from long-range, low-data-rate communication.

**Key Features:**
- Based on **Arduino Pro Mini (ATmega328P)**
- Powered at **3.3V**, clocked at **8 MHz**
- Integrated **RFM95W LoRa Module**
- Supports **UART, I2C, SPI**
- Extremely low power draw in sleep mode

### FTDI1232 Programmer

Used to upload code and perform serial communication with the Arduino Pro Mini. It provides USB-to-UART bridging with support for 3.3V logic.

## LoRa + LoRaWAN Integration

### RFM95W LoRa Module

- Frequency: **433 / 868 / 915 MHz** (India: 865–867 MHz)
- Modulation: **LoRa (CSS)**
- Data Rate: **0.3 kbps – 27 kbps**
- Max TX Power: **20 dBm**
- Sleep Current: **~1.2 µA**

### LoRaWAN Stack

- Based on **MCCI LoRaWAN LMIC** Library
- Projects include both **string-based** and **integer-based** payloads
- Compatible with **ChirpStack** and **TTN**

---

## ChirpStack Integration Workflow

1. **Create Device Profile**
   - Add LoRa class, frequency plan, data rate, etc.
2. **Register Device**
   - Add DevAddr, AppSKey, NwkSKey (ABP mode)
3. **Write Codec**
   - Decode payload using JavaScript
4. **Monitor Device Data**
   - Check live uplink data in Application > Device Data

---

## InfluxDB + Grafana Visualization

- **InfluxDB** stores real-time sensor values pushed via ChirpStack
- **Grafana** visualizes the time-series data with dashboards

### Steps:
1. Generate token in InfluxDB (enable read/write)
2. Integrate InfluxDB in ChirpStack (copy token, bucket)
3. Visualize in Grafana: paste Influx queries → choose panel types
